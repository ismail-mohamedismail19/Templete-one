            <h3>BMW interior design</h3>
            <p>The cabin of each BMW vehicle is planned with ergonomic configurations that meet the needs of practicality and comfort for the driver. Before instrument panels and the center console are installed, attention to the tiniest details is paid to ensure the utmost in driver comfort. If you’ll take a close look you’ll note that these elements are angles toward the driver to put them within his or her reach. It’s not a situation of one size fits all when it comes to these configurations. Each model gets its special attention. This individual approach ensures that each model portrays a distinct personality. Control elements are integrated into optimal positioning to ensure that the interior design reflects premium quality and perfection of placement.</p>

            <h3>BMW compared with Mercedes Benz</h3>
            <p>Wonderful Engineering points out that the interiors of a BMW and Mercedes go in two completely different directions. It’s almost like comparing apples with oranges. Although Mercedes has established a reputation for creating the most luxurious interiors, BMW instead, focuses on ergonomics. An inspection of the interiors of each immediately reveals the differences. If you look, you’ll discover that the BMW has taken great effort to ensure that the driver is surrounded by user controls that are placed in the most convenient locations for ease of access. This is the most obvious difference when the two are compared side by side. While the Mercedes targets a more mature audience of drivers, the BMW is all about the younger drivers who appreciate power, performance, and a useful and easy to navigate interior.</p>

BMW hasn’t inclined to overstuff their cabins with features that are not practical. BMW designers don’t add equipment or special design features for the sake of the looks of the inside of the car. There is a purpose for everything added to the cabin.
